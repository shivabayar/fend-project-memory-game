# Memory Game Project

This is a web application developed just for fun using **html5, css3 & bootstrap**.
There is **no pre-installation** required for this project as the compiled files are either
included in the source code or fetched using CDN.

What is this game and how to play?
  This is a simple age old matching the cards game where user can flip 2 cards at once and if they don't match then they are flipped right back. By flipping the cards randomly by users and remembering the positions of a matched card users can match the card by flipping 2 matching cards. After the cards are matched they stay up right displaying the symbol in the card. Similarly user plays uses this trick to match the entire deck. The beauty of the game is to decrease the number of steps taken everytime one play the game.
